#Payouts
For everyone that's working on paid projects / tickets the following chart defines awards and penalties in regards of timeliness. For those that are in apprentice role or take on unpaid work just XP changes apply.

| Deadline hit by      | XP change | Payout adjustment |
|----------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| <75% of estimate     | +3        | +20%              |
| 75%-100% of estimate | 0         | 0                 |
| 101-110% of estimate | -1        | -10%              |
| 111-125% of estimate | -2        | -25%              |
| 126-140% of estimate | -3        | -40%              |

If deadline not hit by 140% of estimated time, project / ticket is reviewed with the person assigned and payout revoked if there's no good reason for the delay.
