#XP Explained

XP stands for experience points and everyone working with The Shop in any form starts with some XP value based on how they 
started with us. 

XP is gained and lost through feedback on everything you do with us and its value defines your role with us. 

XP is one and only metric for tracking performance and it directly reflects everything from your seniority to your salary.

Your role with us is also derived from your current XP. Since we have multiple roles there are ranges of XP that 
will define your current role:
 
|XP range  | Role name       |
|----------|-----------------|
| 50-200   | Student role    |
| 201-400  | Apprentice role |
| 401-600  | Junior role     |
| 601-800  | Standard role   |
| 801-1000 | Senior role     |
| 1000+    | Leader role     |

Deadlines and code quality affect your XP.
