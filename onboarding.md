Welcome to The Shop!

This short document explains basics about what you need to do in order to get fully started.

## First steps

  2. Create [GitHub account](https://github.com/) and [Gmail account](https://gmail.com)
  3. Register on internal application [http://platform.the-shop.io/](http://platform.the-shop.io) with gmail account
  4. Fill in your profile information on the application
  5. Watch this repository to get notified of any changes to it. [Instructions are here.](https://help.github.com/articles/watching-repositories/)
