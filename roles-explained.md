*Note: this is still work in progress and can be modified in the future - please watch for changes*

There are 6 roles within The Shop:
  1. Student role
  2. Apprentice role
  3. Junior role
  4. Standard role
  5. Senior role
  6. Leader role

Each of the roles brings certain expectations with it so please read through.

## Student role
Student role is our mechanism for teaching people how to work and how to improve their knowledge so that they get hired. Everyone can follow the [onboarding](onboarding.md) instructions and see how they go. Since this is student role there is just one basic rule to obey - if you set yourself as available on platform and start working on a task you should handle it and communicate progress (or lack of it) to project owner in time. 

Notes: 

1. This is not a hired position within the company
2. Each newly registered user starts with 50 XP.

## Apprentice role
Apprentice role is slightly more experienced version of student role and is intended for pre-junior level of expertese but it is also first hired position.

There are some expecations in place for this role:

1. Your performance will be tracked and compared against the minimum requirements for the role
2. You'll have mentor and it's expected of you to ping them on every blocker you cannot solve by yourself in reasonable time or don't (fully) understand
3. You are required to communicate with your mentor clearly and in timely manner every day you're working

## Junior role
This is the second level of payed position within The Shop and as such comes with a bit more requirements. At this stage you will be working various projects, but mainly internal. 

Role expectations:

1. Your code style will have to match language standards
2. You will go through more strict code reviews - poor implementations will be rejected even if fully functional
3. All expectations from previous role apply

## Standard role
First mentorship role within The Shop. This means that, since you're no longer a Junior developer, you know how to write great quality code in timely manner.

Role expectations:

1. You will have roles below you as a responsiblity to both mentor and review their code
2. You will have to be able to organize your work for minimal management because of #1
3. All expectations from previous role apply

## Senior role
As someone in senior role, your responsibilities are management of all roles already listed and leading projects development
(from both code architecture and management perspectives).

Role expectations:

1. Highly independend developer with vast experience in multiple technologies
2. You implement write whole project by yourself from all development aspects and handle the infrastructure
3. All expectations from previous role apply

## Leader role
This role is still yet to be claimed. When a person gets to this role, it's assumed that you're strong and independent person that helps everyone within the company any way you can. From mentorship and advice perspecives. This role will also unlock the "percentage" type of salary - this means that after all other expenses 90% of the money that you've gained goes towards your salary. Remaining 10% will go towards re-investments of the company...

("other expenses" listed above are including but not limited to: equipment, paid trips,...)
